            Generally, University jurisdiction to adjudicate complaints and to impose sanctions under this code shall be limited 
            to misconduct that occurs on University property, 
            at University-sponsored activities, or behavior which intentionally or recklessly interferes with the operation of the University

            including, but not limited to, studying, teaching, research, University administration, fire, police, or emergency services.
            All cases reported do not always fall under the jurisdiction of the Judicial Branch.  When this situation occurs, the case is often referred to other
            policies at Kansas State University.  Below are several of the policies cases can be referred to.

                                 <h5>OUR AIM</h5>
                                 <p>It aims to ensure fair treatment of students and serve as a judicial authority 
                                     for resolving complaints and appeals. Judicial boards offer authoritative means to impose 
                                     sanctions and levy disciplinary actions against students found to be in misconduct or engaging
                                      in harassment of fellow students. For students who feel they have been wronged, the judicial system
                                       often serves as an avenue of last resort after they fail to resolve their issues by other means.</p>

                                 <h5>OUR FOCUS</h5>
                                 <p>The focus of the judicial branch is to foster the growth and development of individual students through 
                                     the encouragement of self- discipline, accountability and responsibility to the community.
                                      A respect for the rights and privileges of others is the core of this philosophy. 
                                      Responsibility for proper conduct is put upon the student – not the institution – with 
                                      the assumption that most students do not try to intentionally cause violations, and will 
                                      respect the rights and property of others.</p>

                                 <h5>OUR GOALS</h5>
                                 <p>The goals of the Judicial Board process are to redirect the behavior of students into acceptable patterns,
                                      to protect the rights and privileges of all students and to encourage educational development. 
                                      The main advantage of a student judicial system is that when peer influence is exerted through 
                                      a structured process, it can often be the most effective and positive means of accomplishing the goals of the system.</p>
